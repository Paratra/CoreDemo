Question

How do I create a .JAR file?

Answer 1

For example, if you want to create TCPClient.jar executable file.
First, you need to create a file "manifest" with the following content:

Main-Class: TCPClient

Please input an "Enter" at the end of this line, then you could run:

jar cvmf manifest TCPClient.jar TCPClient.class

to generate jar file and run it with:

java -jar TCPClient.jar

ava Archive (JAR) files allow developers to package many classes into a single file. JAR files also use compression, so this can make applets and applications smaller.

Creating a .JAR file is easy. Simple go to the directory your classes are stored in and type :-

jar -cf myfile.jar *.class
If your application or applet uses packages, then you'll need to do things a little differently. 
Suppose your classes were in the package mycode.games.CoolGame
- you'd change to the directory above mycode and type the following :- (Remember to use / on UNIX systems)

jar -cf myfile.jar .\mycode\games\CoolGame\*.class
Now, if you have an existing JAR file, and want to extract it, you'd type the following

jar -xf myfile.jar
Working with JAR files isn't that difficult, especially if you've used the unix 'tar' command before. 
If you're planning on packaging an applet for Internet Explorer, or an application for Microsoft's jview, 
you might also want to consider .CAB files.
